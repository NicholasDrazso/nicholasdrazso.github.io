            Various projects that showcase my mechanical design, fabrication, and assembly skills. I did alot more at Botbuilt 
            but unfortunately I cannot post information or pictures/videos about it. The work that I can talk about is included 
            on my resume which can be downloaded under the "Contact" section listed above.

                        <p>This was the project I spent the majority of my time on during this co-op. At one point, I was working 70h weeks 
                            for a month in attempt to complete this project by the extremely ambitious deadline. Here are some of the 
                            progression pictures that I was able to capture along the way. There was so much behind the scenes that I did not 
                            including the 500+ 3d printed parts, 100 sheet metal parts, and thousands of dollars worth of mcmaster carr orders 
                            that I was responsible for, but here are some major pictures.</p>

                        <p>I spent some time MIG and stick welding at Botbuilt. I taught myself through Youtube videos briefly. I recognize they 
                            are not the cleanest or best welds but they got the job done. I look forward to mastering this skill in
                             the future whether it is through my next co-ops, school design teams, night school during co-ops, or 
                             personal projects.</p>

                        <p>
                            Originally I did not have the option to use compressed air since all of the solenoid ports were being
                             used on the robot, so I started with a small electronic fan with different nozzle designs with the 
                             hope that it would be enough air flow to blow off wood dust but unfortunately, after many attempts, 
                             no design really worked. I really pushed to try and make the pneumatic option worked and after some 
                             reworking of the pneumatic circuit on the robot side, we were able to open up a port for me to use. 
                             From there, I began prototyping a pneumatic design and quickly developed a working solution that 
                             works flawlessly.
