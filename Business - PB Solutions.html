          Page under construction. I loved tinkering and troubleshooting with my
          own paintball equipment and couldnt afford to get it repaired by other
          companies so I learned to do it myself. I became pretty good at it and
          realized there was an opportunity to start servicing other peoples
          equipment and make money. I approached my local field and started
          doing it there when I was 11 then after about 1 season it really blew
          up and I started to make a name for myself. I then upgraded to bigger
          fields and bigger events and got some friends and trained them as
          employees. After 2 seasons, at 14 years old, I was servicing events up
          to 1000 people with 3 employees under a tent. It became pretty
          successful until COVID shut down most of the fields within a 3h drive
          and I got busy with university, so I officially stopped around 2019
          but this was my first taste of real entrepreneurship and it made me
          realize how in love with this I was! In the future I hope to follow a
          passion of mine and make my own company around it!

          I need to find pictures of my tent setup but you can picture a desk
          with a trailer and a pop up tent and a banner with my company name on
          it with some tables and testing equipment nearby.

          Here are some pictures including my team which I point out with the
          red arrows. We not only did repairs, but we played and were usually in
          key leadership positions even though we were younger. We gained the
          respect of everyone over the years and we were helping to create a
          tight community and we were successful at it. We were even featured in
          a paintball magazine from Quebec! This community is where I
          strengthened my ability to work in a team in high stress environments.
          Below are pictures of us playing and with some trophies! I could add
          another 100+ pictures, but we would be here forever haha.
