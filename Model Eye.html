            This is a model human eye that I made for grade 10 science class.

            <p>The requirements were:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Display major components of the human eye</li>

            </div>
            <p>
                I decided to make my model eye 3D because it was the best way to show off the different components of 
                the human eye. Since there are important features on the inside of the eye, I wanted to make the model 
                telescopic.

        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="title">Construction</h2>
            <p>
                I cut, glued, and painted some scrap wood to create the base of the model. I cut a 1.25” hole in the top piece of the base for a 
                1.25” piece of PVC pipe to sit in. Then, I cut a 1.25” hole in the bottom of a plastic bowl for the back half of the eye. I painted 
                and glued the back half of the eye to the 1.25” tube. Next, I glued 2 small plates together then sanded the assembly. Then, I 
                painted it white as a base coat and then painted it to be the iris and pupil of the eye and glued to the end of a 0.75” PVC pipe.

                Next, for the lens, I glued two small plastic dishes together and drilled holes for the dowels and a 1” hole for the 1” PVC pipe 
                in the center. Then, I glued the dowels into the drilled holes. Next, I sanded and painted the front part of the eye and glued the 
                lens assembly on to the front part of the eye making sure it was centered. Then, I placed and glued the entire front assembly on to 
                the 1” PVC pipe.

                Finally, I added a small plastic cover on the front half of the bowl to cover the iris assembly. Then, I put the 1” 
                pipe assembly into the 1.25” assembly/base, and then the 0.75” iris assembly into the 1” pipe to create the full telescopic model.

            <p>
                Overall, this project was not technical but I think it showcases my creativeness and resourcefulness. My grade 10 teacher kept the 
                project and is currently using it as a teaching aid.
