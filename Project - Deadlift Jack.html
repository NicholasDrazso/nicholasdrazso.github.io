            This is a wooden deadlift jack. It is used to assist in loading plates on to the bar for deadlifts.

            <p>
                During a co-op in North Carolina, I joined a private powerlifting gym and enjoyed the luxeries that they had to offer. One of these 
                luxieries was a full size deadlift jack. A deadlift jack is a weightlifting accessory that is designed to help lift and load plates 
                onto the bar when performing deadlifts. The jack is placed under the bar and used to raise the bar slightly off the ground. The image below 
                illustrates the jack I was using with the height slightly off the ground.

                <img class="resize" src="images/Deadlift Jack/Rogue Deadlift Jack.png">

                The small gap that is made makes it easier to slide plates on and off the bar. Without the jack, loading the kilogram powerlifting plates was nearly 
                impossible since they required 2 hands to hold due to them being so thin and slippery. During the 4 months I became accustomed to using 
                a jack and when I came home, I did not have access to one. This meant that loading and unloading plates from the bar was difficult, time 
                consuming, and increased the amount of unneccessary strain that I put on myself during the loading and unloading process. There are simple 
                solutions that people use or recommend such as:
            </p>

            <div class="list-contents">
                <ol>
                    <li>Rolling the weight on the bar on to a smaller plate that is on the ground to prop up one side to create the gap</li>
                    <li>Lifting on side of the bar with one hand while loading with the plate with the other hand</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <p>
                Unfortunately, both of these solutions pose their own issues for me:
            </p>

            <div class="list-contents">
                <ol>
                    <li>The plates at home are octagons and therefore are hard to roll on to the smaller plate</li>
                    <li>The plates at school do not have a handle to hold on to to load with 1 hand while lifting the bar with the other hand</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <p>
                Since these simple solutions did not work for me, I decided to create my own personal jack to make my life easier. 
            </p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="title">Design</h2>
            <p>The requirements were:</p>
            <div class="list-contents">
                <ol>
                    <li>Fit in my gym bag</li>
                    <li>Able to hold 495lbs without breaking or experiencing major deformation</li>
                    <li>Does not fall over when loading or unloading plates</li>
                    <li>Provide space between the bottom of the plate and the ground</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <p>
                First, I determined the largest size of jack that I could fit in to my bag was 24" long. From there, I chose to draw a 19" x 5" rectangle 
                since I wanted it to be as long as possible to provide maximum leverage but still slightly smaller than the maximum size to make it 
                easier to pack in my bag. Then, I looked at common dimensions for plates and drew the hole for the bar slightly higher than the radius 
                of the plate to ensure there would be a gap from the bottom of the plate to the ground. The average powerlifting bar has a 29mm (1.14") 
                diameter but I made the hole 1 5/16" (1.3125") since that was the closest hole saw bit I had. Next, I marked out a handle, estimating 
                a reasonable width. For the location of the handle, I placed it directly in line above the hole where the bar will sit to ensure that 
                there is approximately 0 distance in the x direction so there would be no moment. I took into consideration that there would be 
                large moment on this handle created from the distance in the y direction so I made sure to keep the width dimension as large as 
                I could while maintaining something comfortable to use. Then, I made some more cuts to allow for easier loading of the bar and rolling 
                of the jack. 
            </p>

            <h2 class="title">Construction</h2>
            <p>
                I chose to use wood for this project since I had material sitting around and the material would not damage the bars at the gym. 
                I found some scrap 3/4" plywood in my basement, cut 2 rectangles from it using my table saw, and glued them together. From there, 
                I measured and drew the cut lines for the handle, bar holder, and rolling features. I then used my drill with a 1 5/16" hole saw bit 
                to cut the hole for the bar. Then used my bandsaw to cut out the handle and rolling features. Next, I sanded the handle edges for 
                comfort, and finished the entire piece with 3 coats of polyurethane since I expected the jack to get beat up in my bag and during use.

            <h2 class="title">Testing</h2>
            <p>
                I went to the gym the next day to test it. To start, it fit in my gym bag therefore the first requirement was fufilled. Next, I progressed 
                from 0-3 plates and completed my workout with any issue so the 3rd and 4th requirements were fufilled. Finally, I loaded 5 plates on to 
                the bar and it rolled without any issue meaning all requirements were fufilled. I was extremely impressed with how easy it was to roll
                the bar. It almost felt the same as the full size jack I was used to from before, but at a fraction of the size. 
                The only issue I had was after 2 plates, I would have to be more gentle when loading or unloading plates because if I was too agressive 
                then the jack would tend to want to fall sideways. This issue is not huge but it is slighly annoying.

            <p>
                Overall, I am very happy with the outcome of this project. I was able to find a problem and develop a simple and 
                effective solution for cheap.
