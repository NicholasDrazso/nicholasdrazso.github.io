                This is the project that made me fall in love with the engineering process. The highs, lows, failures, 
                successes, late nights, and struggles all led to completing the project. The best part was that is was 
                with 2 great friends and that we were able to pull this off in such a short time period. There was no 
                manual on how to do this, we just started. It was through the failures which we learned the most. This 
                project taught me that the simple design is usually the best. Now that I am writing this 4 years later, 
                I am realizing that without the proper team, this would not have been possible so moving forward, 
                I understand that having the right people on the team is so much more important than what the team 
                necessarily knows technically.

                <h2 class="title">Ball Launch Mechanism</h2>

                The ball launch mechanism was a roller coaster of emotions. It took alot of testing to get the gear ratio 
                correct and the spacing correct for the ball to get projected out properly. The idea was to replicate a 
                gear box and a fly wheel. The code made the motor ramp up in speed over a small amount of time. I decided 
                to leave the audio in just to convey the emotions we went through even through there is swearing so I 
                apologize.

                <h2 class="title">Ball Detection Mechanism</h2>

                The seesaw concept was required since we couldnt detect a single ball. The sensor was not good enough to 
                detect something that small so to increase the surface area, I built a seesaw out of legos. When the ball 
                goes down it blocked the sensor and it was programmed such that if the measurement was less than 10cm, it 
                would decrease the ball count. It was good that the difference in measurement readings was high since 
                there would be random mismeasurements ranging from 20-30 cm during regular operation, so as a buffer, 
                we made it less than 10cm and there were no issues.

                        <h3>Concept</h3>
                        <p class="work-words">To ensure the sensor was able to read the ball falling down, I simulated it 
                            and recorded the distanced measured and analyzed it in slow motion to ensure the sensor could 
                            read the change fast enough. Luckily, it was able to but the accuracy was not that good so in 
                            the code, it was made a range to ensure it acted very binary.</p>

                <h2 class="title">Ball Launch and Flippers</h2>

                Originally, we had the flippers and the entire game logic running separately in our code. But after 
                consulting with the professor, they said it was too easy so they made us come up with another way. 
                We ended up using a lot of booleans and if statements to represent different game states and the 
                whole thing gets run over and over in a while loop. We realize this is severely inefficient but it 
                was what was asked of us to do. This video shows us successfully redoing our code in this style and 
                as you can tell, we were very happy.

                <h2 class="title">Ball Launch and Ball Release</h2>

                The design of the ball release mechanism is severely flawed since the timing fully relies on the angle that
                 the box is on. The difference between a successful release and an unsuccessful one was only a few ticks 
                 on the encoder. Unfortunately we did not have time to redesign this system once we realized how flawed 
                 it was. The best we could do was to get the timing as good as we could and release the ball once the ball 
                 launch system was up to max speed. This timing also changed based on how many balls were in the lineup so 
                 unfortunately this was a major flaw. I discuss alternative designs further in the report that is 
                 downloadable at the bottom of this page.
