            <p>
                This is a trebuchet that was built for a grade 12 physics project. We created this without many calculations or tests,
                we just went for it. It is designed based on a whipper trebuchet which seemed to work extremely well. We were able to
                 launch a tennis ball 100+m with only 35lb of weight. Unfortunately I did not take any progress pictures and the final launch videos
                  are poor quality, but based on the audio you should be able to hear the whipping noise generated by the
                   trebuchet which should give you some incling to how powerful the trebuchet was.

                            first time that we tried it and it worked which was an awesome feeling.</p>

                            ball trajectory. We began to find the optimal setting so the balls trajectory would be at approximately
                             45 degrees.

                Unfortunately the final videos are poor quality but something is better than nothing. We shattered the school record with our design.
