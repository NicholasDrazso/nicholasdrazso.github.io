            This is a trebuchet that was built for a grade 12 physics project. We created this without many calculations or tests,
             we just went for it. It is designed based on a whipper trebuchet which seemed to work extremely well. We were able to
              launch a tennis ball 100+m with only 35lb of weight. Unfortunately I did not take any progress pictures and the video
               is extremely poor quality, but based on the audio you should be able to hear the whipping noise generated by the
                trebuchet which should give you some incling to how powerful the trebuchet is.
