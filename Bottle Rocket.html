            This is a bottle rocket that works off pressurized air and water. It also has a parachute system.

                In a team of 2, this project was designed, constructed, and tested within 2 weeks.

            <p>
            We used the theory of a voltage divider for the design. 
            A nichrome wire was wound around a piece of acryllic that acted as a single resistor. 
            This resistor was split into 2 resistors with a copper wire. 
            The resistance that the output voltage experienced was determined by how far along 
            the copper wire was on the resistive coil. This distance was directly related to the length of the object being measured.

            <h2 class="title">Calibration</h2>
            <p>
                To calibrate, we used machine shop guage blocks to as a reference distance then recorded the voltage output based on the known measurement.
                A voltage vs distance graph was plotted and the equation of the line was taken to be the calibration equation. 
                To obtain the tolerance, we used the calibration equation with the already recorded voltages to collect a set of calculated lengths. 
                Since each voltage corresponds to a true length and now a calculated length, a deviation between the two can be calculated by subtracting 
                the calculated length from the true length. 
                A graph of true length to deviation was plotted and the maximum and minimum y values were taken to be the +/- values for the tolerance.

            <p>
                Although we did hit the requirement of the +/-0.5cm during calibration, we did not come close to this during presentation. Instead, we were calculating values +/- 3cm from the true length. 
                We determined that due to:
                <div class="list-contents">
                    <ol>
                        <li>the resistive wire shifting along the acryllic path</li>
                        <li>the wired connections becoming loose at the power supply and measurement position</li>
                        <li>the copper measurement wire not maintaining a consistent contact point to the resistive coil</li>
                        <li>the copper measurement wire oxidizing from calibration to presentation</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                the calibration equation changed and therefore we were calculating lengths that were not close to the true lenths.
