                <h2 class="title">Launch Attempts</h2>

                There were 2 parachute deployment systems that were created. The first one was a complicated pendulum system that 
                used a string and an internal weight to detect when the rocket had flipped. Unfortunately the airforce prevented 
                the cap from falling off therefore the rocket crashed and the system got destroyed. The second system was a more 
                simple and clever design. It relied on the fact that the rocket would be approximately stationary at the top and 
                that there would be no force acting on the nose cone. This meant the internal balloon and external rubber band 
                pulling on the side flap would overcome the outside air force and push the nose cone off which would push the 
                parachute out. The side flap was connected to a hair pin flap so that prior to launch, the nose cone would be 
                held in place, but immediately at the beginning of the launch, the hair pin flap would get pushed down and the 
                only thing stopping the nose cone from popping off was the air force during flight. Unfortunately, we put the 
                parachute below the balloon which prevented it from deploying properly so this version also crashed. If we 
                switched the order so the parachute was sitting on top of the balloon, it would have worked. Another reason that 
                the parachute may have not fully deployed was that it was stuck due to static electricity/friction since it was 
                such a large piece of a garbage bag. Changing the material may have led to better results. Unfortunately we were 
                not allowed to test prior to our test launches so it was just us using our best judgement. In grade 11, I did not 
                think that the material choice mattered so much but looking back now, it clearly does.
