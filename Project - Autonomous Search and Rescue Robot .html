          FINALLY!! A school project that is all about building something and
          solving a problem. We were applying theory to a physical thing and
          troubleshooting...it is just perfect. The late nights, early mornings,
          smacking your head against the desk because you have no idea why it
          isnt working, then you do that for way too long, take a walk and in
          the middle of that you have that sudden realization that you can try
          one last thing so you race back and try it and it works. This project
          is the definition of that feeling. For 3 months, I have never seen a
          group work as hard as we did, commit so much time and effort, yet
          still find time to laugh and love spending time together. This is
          another one of those projects that continued to make me fall in love
          with engineering and I am happy to share it with you.

          <h2 class="title">Project Background and Summary</h2>

          <p>
            As part of my most recent semester, I completed MTE 380, a
            mechatronics design course where student teams are tasked with
            developing a complete engineering solution from concept to final
            product in just 3 months. Our goal was to build the most optimized
            robot possible: one that could autonomously follow a line, retrieve
            a LEGO figure, deliver it to the nearest green box, and return to
            the starting position, all while being fast, lightweight, and highly
            reliable.
          </p>

          <p>
            We decided to fully commit to that challenge and see what we could
            end up with.
          </p>

          <p>
            After the 3 months, we ended up with a 131g autonomous
            search-and-rescue robot that completed its mission in just 13
            seconds with a 100% reliability score (3/3 runs).
          </p>

          <p>
            The robot featured computer vision for line following, encoder-based
            PD control, a custom 4-layer PCB chassis, custom 3D printed and
            silicone-molded wheels, and a LEGO figure gripper mechanism. We also
            designed and tested a suction-based downforce system (inspired by
            micromouse robots), which was ultimately left out due to power
            constraints, but this project pushed us to explore new ideas and
            validate through testing.
          </p>

          <p>
            With well over 1200 team hours including countless late nights and a
            few all-nighters, we poured everything we had into this project. We
            designed and tested 15 gripper arms, 70 custom impellers, and 2
            custom PCBs. From coding and tuning our PD controller to debugging
            every detail of the mechanical and electrical systems, we iterated
            continuously right up until the last minute.
          </p>

          <p>
            Under a tight timeline, we focused on squeezing out every bit of
            performance optimizing for high speed, low mass, and high
            reliability.
          </p>

          <p>
            The final result? First place in the class, with a performance score
            68x higher than the second-place team.
          </p>

          <p>
            Huge shoutout to the team for every early morning, late night,
            frustrating bug, last-minute idea, and breakthrough moment. I'm
            incredibly proud of what we built and even more proud of the people
            I built it with. Shoutout Nathan Rowe, Natalie Tsang, Chelsea
            Dmytryk, and Lili Strong for being the best teammates I could have
            ever asked for, be sure to check them out on LinkedIn!
          </p>

          <p>
            My biggest takeaway? It takes a team of like-minded, dedicated
            people to do something amazing.
          </p>

          <h2 class="title">My Role</h2>
          <p>
            In this 5-person design challenge, I led the development of the
            suction system, mechanical-electrical integration, and co-designed
            the PCB. I also took a systems integration and project management
            perspective to ensure the electrical, mechanical, and software
            subsystems worked together reliably under tight deadlines. Key
            contributions included:
          </p>

          <ol style="margin-left: 20px; padding-left: 20px">
            <li>

          </ol>

          <p>
            Also note that althought I was the project manager, after we set
            initial deadlines, we all worked together almost 100% of the time so
            there was almost no managing people, it was mostly making sure key
            decisions were made at critical times and making sure everybody
            stayed healthy and excited about the project! We were definitely all
            1000% on board with the mission which was a huge part of our
            success. Finally, thanks to: Nathan Rowe, Natalie Tsang, Chelsea
            Dmytryk, and Lili Strong for making this project possible! None of
            this would have been possible without who I believe is the best team
            I could have ever asked for! Make sure you check them out on
            LinkedIn!
          </p>

          <h2 class="title">Performance Index (PI)</h2>
          <p>The competition used the following metric to determine success:</p>

          <p>$$ PI = \frac{C}{R \cdot m \cdot t^2} $$</p>

          <ul style="margin-left: 20px; padding-left: 20px">
            <li>
              R = number of failed runs (0.75 for 3 successful runs, 0.9 for 2
              successful runs, 1 for 1 successful run)
            </li>
            <li>m = robot mass (g)</li>
            <li>t = time to complete task (s)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            This incentivized designs that were light, fast, and reliable. Our
            131g robot completed the full challenge in 13.0 seconds, succeeded
            in all 3 runs, and scored 68x higher than the next closest team.

          <h2 class="title">Suction Downforce System</h2>

          <p>
            To increase cornering performance beyond the friction-limited cap, I
            led the development of a suction fan system with custom impellers
            and skirts. While ultimately cut from the final run due to power
            instability, the system was fully functional and validated through
            structured paramaterized testing.
          </p>

          <h3>Why Downforce? Derivation from First Principles</h3>

          <p>
            Since there were so many turns on the course and knowing our motors
            were capable of such high speed (over 3 m/s), I knew the cornering
            speed is where we would be limited so I started attacking that
            problem from first principles. Starting with the FBD for our robot
            around a corner, it is clear why additional downforce is required.
          </p>

          <div class="pinball-list">
            <div class="work">
              <img
                class="img"
                src="images/MTE 380/SUCTION_theory_derivation.png"
              />
              <h3>FBD of robot turning</h3>
              <p class="work-words"></p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>We start from Newton's Second Law:</p>
          <p>$$ \sum F = ma $$</p>

          <p>Because the robot is cornering:</p>
          <p>$$ \sum F_{\text{radial}} = ma $$</p>

          <p>
            From a free-body diagram, the only force contributing to centripetal
            acceleration is friction:
          </p>
          <p>$$ F_c = F_f = \mu F_N $$</p>

          <p>And since \( a = \frac{v^2}{r} \) for circular motion:</p>
          <p>$$ \mu F_N = m \left( \frac{v^2}{r} \right) $$</p>

          <hr />

          <h4>Without Suction (No Artificial Downforce)</h4>
          <p>Letting \( F_N = mg \):</p>
          <p>$$ \mu mg = m \left( \frac{v^2}{r} \right) $$</p>

          <p>Simplifying:</p>
          <p>$$ v = \sqrt{ \mu r g } $$</p>

          <p>
            This gives a fixed \( v_{\text{max}} \) once \( \mu \) is known.
            Substituting values:
          </p>
          <p>
            $$ v_{\text{max}} = \sqrt{1.2 \cdot 0.15 \cdot 9.81} \approx
            \boxed{1.33 \, \text{m/s}} $$
          </p>

          <hr />

          <h4>With Suction (Artificial Downforce)</h4>
          <p>
            Now, let the normal force be increased by suction downforce \( F_d
            \):
          </p>
          <p>$$ \mu (mg + F_d) = m \left( \frac{v^2}{r} \right) $$</p>

          <p>Solving for velocity:</p>
          <p>$$ v = \sqrt{ \frac{r \mu (mg + F_d)}{m} } $$</p>

          <p>Substituting values:</p>
          <p>
            $$ v = \sqrt{ \frac{ 1.2 \cdot 0.15 \cdot \left[ (0.131)(9.81) +
            0.148 \right] }{ 0.131 } } \approx \boxed{1.40 \, \text{m/s}} $$
          </p>

          <p>
            With \( \mu = 1.2 \) determined experimentally using a ramp and
            sample, based on the relation: $$ \tan(\theta) = \mu \quad \text{at
            slip} $$
          </p>

          <p>
            The predicted cornering velocity under various downforce levels is
            summarized below, including the measured value.

          <p>
            Although the theoretical max cornering velocity only increased by
            0.07 m/s, this would still boost our performance index by
            approximately 3% which is alot considering we are trying to push the
            limit as much as possible. Also note that these results can
            definitely be better with more time and simulation and research put
            in. This was just a small piece of the puzzle that I was able to
            achieve in a short time span starting from scratch!

            I chose to do some preliminary research about impeller desings and
            realized it is a very dense subject. After I started to see lots of
            different pictures and information on impeller design, I was left
            with 2 options.
          </p>
          <ol style="margin-left: 20px; padding-left: 20px">
            <li>
              Try to calculate and make the best impeller purely by theory and
              then simulate the results and iterate on a computer
            </li>
            <li>
              Determine the parameters I need to change about impellers and 3D
              print a tonne of them and do testing to see how different
              parameters affect the performance then "create" the optimal
              impeller from there
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            Given the timeline, I felt like learning CFD well enough and given
            the potential for me to mess up calculations or simulation, I opted
            for the second option. This meant I would 3D print as many impellers
            as required to vary 1 parameter at a time. Below I list the
            parameters I changed and also a picture of just a fraction of the
            impellers I tested.

          <p>
            Each impeller was tested on a 3D printed robot-shaped test chassis
            over five timed runs down a 25Â° 1' ramp using a fixed 5V, 0.5A power
            supply on the motor. Below is a video of what my test setup looked
            like:

            Below compares the main takeaways, mainly a 5 bladed radial impeller
            design is much better than any compression style. They both shared
            the similarity that performance was clearly peaked at 5 blades and
            fell off extremely once there was an increase to 7 or a decrease to
            2. The most surprising thing was 2 blades had similar results to 7
            blades and that 3 blades was better than 6 blades, but 5 was a clear
            winner with 4 not trailing too far behind.

          <h3>Skirt Design and Testing</h3>
          <p>
            The skirt system needed to create a seal against the course while
            being low friction and not catching on the lips between the tiles on
            the course. I iterated a few designs listed below and shown:
          </p>

          <ul style="margin-left: 20px; padding-left: 20px">

            <li>felt + thin tape</li>
            <li>felt+mylar (thick document cover plastic from dollar store)</li>
            <li>PLA side rails + thin tape + thin dynamic PLA plate</li>
          </ul>

          </ul>
          <p>
            The final version also was able to move up and down while still
            maintaining a good enough seal to create some sort of suctioning
            effect thanks to the side rails.

                This is the exact one used for final testing, noting that the
                extra cutouts were for PCB through hole components sticking
                through the board and the roller ball cutout was made much
                larger.

            Paired with the best impeller, this configuration yielded the best
            traction test results and met my requirements while staying very
            light since I printed with almost no infill and the actual skirt was
            printed at 0.5mm layer height.
          </p>

          <h3>Why It Was Not Used</h3>
          <p>
            We originally specked a more efficient motor, but a vendor mix-up
            forced us to use a higher-power fan motor, which disrupted our
            original power budget calculations significantly. While our 220 mAh
            25C drone LiPos (2x 6g) should have supplied 5.5 A, we saw
            instability in the Pixy2.1, gripper, and motor systems
          </p>

          <p>
            Suspecting false discharge ratings or power ratings for certain
            components and lacking time to verify, we dropped the suction system
            3 days before competition to ensure final system reliability for
            game day so we could focus on completing the mission instead of
            optimizing.
          </p>

          <p>
            The suction system added ~10g. While traction improvements were
            clear, we didn't complete full-course testing with the system, so
            performance impact on full complete runs remains unknown therefore
            it is unclear whether it would have even been worth the extra weight
            but comparing the PI scores on average between runs with the suction
            system on and off would have clearly shown which is better.
          </p>

          <p>
            Looking back I am dissapointed I didnt get to see our robots
            performance with the suction system used because I spent alot of
            time and effort on R&D but I do think we made the right decision at
            the correct time to stop trying to make it work. Those last 3 days
            of tuning and prepping for competition day required all 5 of our
            brains to solve problems and that was without the suction system in
            the way. If we had more time it would have definitely made sense to
            make it work, but I am happy with the outcome of our project.
          </p>

          <h2 class="title">Custom Wheel Design & Optimization</h2>
          <p>
            I developed custom wheels using a high-friction silicone rubber
            compound cast into 3D-printed molds. Early versions featured ribbed
            rims, which caused small tracking deviations and impaired
            straight-line stability which greatly affected our ability to tune
            the PD controller and just introduced unnecessary disturbances.
            After testing, I redesigned the wheels with smooth rims which
            significantly improved linear tracking and consistency during
            straight runs.
          </p>
          <p>
            The final wheel design balanced weight, traction, and manufacturing
            repeatability. Silicone was selected for its high static friction
            against course tiles, allowing us to maximize Î¼ in our cornering
            speed equation, once again optimizing for the time and mass
            variables in the PI score equation.
          </p>

          <p>
            The manufacturing process was pretty simple. Iterate on D slot
            dimension until it fit snugly on the motors D shaft then build the
            mold around it such that the wheel 'snaps' into the bottom to
            position it correctly. Then mix the silicone, place the top cap on
            the rim to make pouring easier, then pour the silicone into the mold
            until it reaches the top where there is a lip to catch any overflow.
            Then to remove it, use the bottom red 'plunger' to pop the rim and
            silicone combo out, give the rim a quick sand and use CA/super glue
            to bond the silicone to the PLA rim. We made a lot of these and
            switched them out to ensure maximum grip at all times because they
            did get dirty over time. Another fun hack we took from micromouse
            was using a tape role and rolling our wheels on it to clean off dirt
            and dust...it worked really well! I was surprised even with the A20
            hardness of the silicone, it did not show any signs of wear and tear
            even when testing on the wooden track for days.

          <p>
            Instead of 3D printing a chassis and putting our boards on that, we
            opted for the PCB to BE the chassis. We werent expecting any major
            loading conditions except for vibrations which we assumed the high
            frequency ones would be damped by the soft silicone wheels and there
            would be too few 'hard' impacts to affect any soldering reliability.
            Just in case, for the final version we opted for a lead based solder
            to ensure these assumptions were incorrect, once again focusing on
            reliability at every level.

            There was lots of debugging for our initial PCB, mainly there was a
            servo issue which ended up being a ground pin that was floating and
            causing unpredictable behaviour. We figured this out through
            systematically tracing each pin starting from power and known
            working pins and working from the parts that worked to the issue. We
            then figured out our problem after systematic troubleshooting and
            grounded that pin to a nearby ground pad. There were a few other
            issues like backwards headers and ICs that needed a new spec due to
            the fan motor changing, so for PCB 2 these updates were made and
            there were zero issues. Also for our second version to allow us to
            debug in real time we added a bluetooth module to connect to the
            teensy instead of having to log a tonne of data which actually
            affected our performance early on in the development process because
            we were overloading the system with printing instead of allowing it
            to process data.

            We used a deterministic state machine: Each robot behavior
            (line-follow, object detect, drop-off, return) was handled by
            structured conditions and transitions.

            We used PD control with the vector output from the pixy2.1 as our
            target and the center of the frame as our current heading then
            corrected the difference between them. We opted for PD and ignored I
            because we believed the steady state error was negligible and would
            only slow down our response compared to a PD controller only. The
            following notes about our PD control should be noted:

            We estimated alot of parameters then did some hand calculations and
            ended up between the Pololu 6V Micro Metal Gearmotors (10:1 or
            30:1). We opted for the 10:1 ratio since by our initial
            calculations, this was still overkill for our speed and torque
            requirements.
          </p>
          <p>The motors features:</p>
          <ul style="margin-left: 20px; padding-left: 20px">

            <li>Torque: 0.02157 Nm</li>
            <li>
              Paired with robot mass and wheel sizing, this gave us a projected
              top speed of ~3.0 m/s well-matched to our goal time.

                We used 2 for the robot and they worked great. We had the pins
                bend at one point but after way too long of troubleshooting, we
                fixed it. The bracket to hold these in used the features near
                the gears to contrain it.

            Looking back, we could only utilize PWM values above 60/255 to move
            our robot and anything below it did not move it. It makes me wonder
            where we went wrong in our calculations or if the start up low power
            of the motor was too low and we did not account for that.
            Regardless, although it made precision movements difficult, we
            adapted by implementing a 'jitter' step whre we pulsed at a high pwm
            for a short period of time and allowed us to make precision movement
            specifically at the LEGO figure pickup stage. This jitter was 1 huge
            reason for our success late in the design process and it also solved
            a problem we did not see coming until a few days before competition
            so it required lots of creative thinking. We also only utilized up
            to 105/255 for our 13s run so it is clear we did not come near our
            peak performance capabilities, but the suction system could have
            helped push it further.

            A key optimization was that we were the only team to stop at the
            closest green box, which is when the clock stopped. Other teams
            returned home. This small rule-based insight saved critical time.

            Also, considering our potential velocity increase would have been
            from 1 m/s (7.5s to the bullseye at approximately 7.5m long of a
            course) to 1.4 m/s would mean that our score could have been way
            faster. Also, if we could improve the pickup system that would be
            ideal. We found a loophole that allowed us to configure the LEGO
            figure with a paperclip and use an electromagnet for acquisition,
            but it was denied by the teaching staff unfortunately. Also, due to
            previous years, they also banned system that launched the LEGO
            figure, so physically grabbing it and moving it was the only option

            <li>
              Shared team goals matter, we all built toward the same vision and
              committed equally

            <li>Testing over calculations on short timelines</li>
            <li>
              Cutting scope is smart when system reliability matters and
              timelines are short
            </li>
            <li>
              Prior art matters, the micromouse projects and competition
              accelerated our overall design as well as other academic research
              papers on line following robots
            </li>
            <li>Simple systems are more tunable, debuggable, and scalable</li>

            hereâ¦it still feels like we could have written double what we did in
            the report, but we were limited to our page count, which we already
            exceeded with this submission. So please, if you have any questions
            reach out and I would love to explain our thinking or answer
            questions! If you are doing a similar project and you came across
            this goodluck! Reach out and tell me about it, I would love to hear
            how you are approaching it and what kind of optimizations you made!
            Also side note...I could have probably added 100 more pictures and a
            couple hours worth of testing videos but I only added the really
            really key points here!
