        </h1>
        <p>
          I am the mechanical team lead responsible for 10 engineering students.
          I work on the hull design but will be offloading to another student in
          the upcoming term and taking a more mentor/big picture/technical
          manager role.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          My friends invited me to join this team at inception. The team had
          previously folded twice before so we were starting from scratch with
          an ambitious timeline of competing in less than 12 months and with a
          budget of less than 20% of most other teams.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I have learned so much about running a team and all the difficulties
          involved with doing design for underwater. I am looking forward to
          continuing this until I graduate as I think it will teach me so much
          about running a startup in the future.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          images to be added soon. we are in design phase right now so nothing
          is finalized as of right now.
